# Food Delivery the Recode!

and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), while exploring Android Architecture and mobile UI.

## Overview

This project is demonstrating how to build the previous Food Delivery app using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose when was originally
build using Typescript and React Native. 

This was a challenge since I had not worked in Kotlin until the start of this year but I found the challenges quite fun to work through. I am
proud of what I managed to accomplish.


### Prerequisites

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

- **Android Studio**: Install [Android Studio Bumblebee (or later)](https://developer.android.com/studio). The IDE bundles the necessary tools.
- **JDK**: Ensure you have JDK 11 or newer installed.
- **Android Device or Emulator**: You can use a physical device or set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) through Android Studio.

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository. Click here to access the repository and clone it to your
   local machine: [Food Delivery Kotlin Recode Repository](https://github.com/theCorgiCoder/kotlin-recode-food-delivery)

```
git clone https://github.com/theCorgiCoder/kotlin-recode-food-delivery
cd kotlin-recode-food-delivery

```

2. Open the Project in Android Studio or your program of choice.

3. Build and Run the App on either an Android physical Device or Emulator.

```
Connect your Android device or start emulator.

If using Android Studio, click the Run button (the green play icon in upper right) or press shift +F10

The app will compile and launch on your selected device/emulator.
```

This project uses Android Emulator to test the app. Youâ€™ll need to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to set this up.
